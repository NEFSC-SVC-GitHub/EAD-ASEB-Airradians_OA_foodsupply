the time point 64 days post-fertilization corresponded with a survival assessment and a culling 
of 125 animals for each replicate. Thus, there is a 'new total' accounting for these that are not
the cause of mortality. You will see discrepancies in our counts and the survival if the 125 removed animals
are not accounted for in your survival calculation.
